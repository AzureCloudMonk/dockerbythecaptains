# Docker By The Captains

## Call to action

This is the work-in-progress [contents for a 17.06 edition](contents-17.06.md).

> Is it feasible to produce a first edition for 17.06? That would mean a release sometime in June. We'd need to start ASAP, and have chapters written in 2-3 weeks to allow 2-3 weeks for editing.

## What is this?

This is an idea for a collaborative book, with many small chapters that can be written in parallel. If a chapter can be completed in a month, then together we can release editions quickly and keep the book up to date - even with Docker’s release schedule. 

As an example, imagine we already had this book out for 17.03. In 17.04 the big feature was stack deploy which might be a new chapter (or an update to a couple of existing chapters on swarm and compose). That would have been easy to do and release a new edition of the book before 17.05. And then with 17.05 we would have added a chapter on multi-stage builds, and get that out before 17.06.

Between the Captains (plus ex-Captains and Jérôme!), there’s a group of people who know pretty much everything about Docker. This would be a great mechanism to distribute that information without any one of us committing a huge chunk of time. 

## Principles

This book is intended to be a must-have reference for Docker:

- always up-to-date (monthly? release schedule)
- always correct (public source & Docker images for every sample)
- written by the world's leading experts
- diversity in content (from beginners to pros)
- diversity in tech (OS & app platforms)
- free to access (website & eBook downloads)
- developed in public

## Format

Could use [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) - although [Magic Book](https://github.com/magicbookproject/magicbook) is more flexible, it can generate a website from the same content.
